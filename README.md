Responsive Portfolio
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

My project has a Portfolio, About/Home and Contact page. 
 On the navigation bar you can go from one page to another. As you change the size of the media, the page responds accordingly and moves the images from a full view of 2 columns and 3 rows to 1 column and 5 rows.

 Portfolio Page - made of 3 rows and 2 columns with images.  It has a relative footer that does not move 

 About/Home page - has my profile information, it consits of a small Bio, picture and links to my Facebook and LinkedIn

 Contact Page - consist of my name and email address.  The submit button while active, does not submit the information anywhere.
